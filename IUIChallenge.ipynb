    "\n",
    "The goal of this program is to brute force test as many numbers as possible to solve problems 1 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts off with 100, the lowest number allowed for n. \n",
    "A function, constructOperationMatrix, will construct a two dimensional matrix containing all possible operation\n",
    "permutations allowed for any n. \n",
    "\n",
    "To provide an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a number, say 1234.\n",
    "12345 is 5 digits long, and it has 3 spots to insert an operation. \n",
    "However we may only insert 1 equal anywhere, but the rest can be a plus or a minus.\n",
    "Example: 1 + 2 + 3 = 4\n",
    "To simplify things, we will ignore the numbers temporarily.\n",
    "[+, +, =]\n",
    "This list, when inserted into any four digit number, will construct an equality. \n",
    "Since there are many more of these operations (for values of n with greater length), figuring out how to construct\n",
    "all of these operations can get tricky.\n",
    "This next step involves ignoring the equal sign.\n",
    "It is simple to construct a list of just plus and minus, as since that is a binary relationship, we can \n",
    "just compute the set of all operations as if we are adding 1 to a binary number, say + is 1 and - is 0.\n",
    "In this system, the function assumes that the number is the same length as n - 2, which our number was 1234, length\n",
    "4, so 4 - 2 = 2. The list without the equals is 2 units long, so all possible sets of operations for a 4-digit number\n",
    "without the equals sign would be this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "    ['-','-'],\n",
    "    ['+','-'],\n",
    "    ['-','+'],\n",
    "    ['+','+']\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, all we have to do is take the length of each of those lists, 2, and add back 1 slot to it. \n",
    "Then, since we now have three slots, simply triplicate the set:\n",
    "```\n",
    " [\n",

    "And now we have the matrix that contains every possible operation allowed within the rules of the competition.\n",
    "What the program does next is it takes a value of n, and computes the matrix of operations for length of n,\n",
    "(but only one time per number length, to save computer resources so it doesn't recompute the matrix every time for n)\n",
    "then inserts the first operation set into number n. \n",
